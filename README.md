This app features ability to add/delete items from cart, update quantity of cart items, and checkout when logged in via next-auth. Paypal sandbox payments are the only active methods of mock payment as of now.

Context API and useReducer with custom useReducer hook are used for state management. JS-cookie used to keep cart contents in cookies upon browser page refresh.

Thanks and credit to [Basir](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingwithBasir) for this great tutorial. It helped me get familiarized with full-stack next.js usage, and I added a few tweeks along the way, such as the custom useReducer hook for the cart context API component.
